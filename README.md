## Homework# 5 Creating a Work Day Scheduler using Third-Party API's


The task for HW # 5 is creating a calender application that gives the user the opprotunity to make a planner for themselves. This application allows the user to save events at certain hours of their work day. We will be given started code and modify it by featuring an updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The key to also have the library work with the current date and time, we need to use momemnt.js
